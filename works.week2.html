<h3>
Picking any 2 object and analysing them. 
The actions acted upon them can be quite interesting and translated to another object with a similar movement to produce an unexpected result

Learning how to code on GitHub/ visual studio code was confusing at first until we discovered w3 studios! 

For our own website, the main difficulties that both of us faced were centralising the image on my personal webpage and ensuring the spacing between our image and paragraphs did not seem awkward. But we had a lot of fun personalising and customising our my website! 

for our combined work page, the 2 of us initially decided to have our images in the middle of the page such that when you hovered over our faces we would wobble but we did not go through with it as the 2 images did not seem to align no matter the different codes we tried. We eventually settled on a nicer and neater design- the one youâ€™re looking at now! :)
