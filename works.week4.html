<h2>ROUGH TRANSITION DIAGRAM</h2>
<p> space </p>

<h3>
  We came up with our idea in this week using our state transition diagram. This first idea that we came up with was to have gunshot sounds coming out whenever the spray bottle is pressed. The reason why weâ€™ve chosen gun shot sounds was because we realised how similar the action of firing a gun and using a spray bottle works- which was pushing an action. Another similarity that we noted was the position of where the bullet and water is being released from which was right above where the pushing action is, thus we wanted to incorporate both objects into one another.
