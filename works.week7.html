<h2>UPDATED TRANSITION DIAGRAM</h2>

<h3>
  For our final idea, we decided to further refine it from the previous ideas that we had to make it easy to understand yet produce an unexpected outcome. We decided to clean up the p5js codes and microbic to ensure that it would give us the exact results that we wanted with no hiccups. 

  To make the project look neater, we shortened the wires used and stuck it to the spray bottle. We then hot glued the various components onto the bottle. We had to place it strategically on the bottle to ensure that the vibrations could be easily felt when the button is pushed and that when the water is sprayed, it does not come into contact with the microbit and make it wet.  
  
  We then decided to spray the bottle in black matte to give it a feel of what a gun would be like. The black also allowed us to give an element of surprise since the water that would be sprayed out would be red which mimics blood. 
  
  On that day itself, we set up a projection on paper to allow users to have a target to shoot at. 
  
  However the day before, after trying to use the microbit, we realised that the vibrations started to become weaker and the button did not work as often as it should be despite having all the wires connected properly. So we decided to let  microbit just rest instead of overworking it.
  On the day itself, the microbit worked successfully for the first 1 and a half hour. However afterward, we weren’t to detect the microbic on p5js or the microbit website for pairing. The vibration worked frequently but we still weren’t able to detect it so we figured it was probably worn out already. However, overall it was quite a successful project for us and we had a lot of fun!

  Another problem that we faced was that the image change from p5js was a little laggy when using the button to press to which we made it better by manually clicking on the screen instead.
